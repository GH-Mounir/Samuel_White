He studied economics but found his true calling in the arts, beginning his journey in university theater and various independent projects. His passion for cinema was ignited early on, and he was greatly influenced by the film 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola, which became an artistic and productive reference for him.",
    "paragraph2": "Since there were no formal film schools in Syria, he started making his own films independently and developed his skills in a self-taught manner. He directed two short films in Syria before moving to Tunisia in 2016 during the Syrian war, continuing to make his independent short films. Between 2017 and 2018, he directed three short films.",

    "paragraph5": "He worked on the production, direction, and writing of his first feature-length narrative film titled 'The Return', 35% of which was filmed in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
