I believe that cinema is not just an art form, but a moral test ... a way to face ourselves without excuses and to reveal the fragile yet resilient human soul.\n\nGrowing up amid conflict and the absence of formal film schools,\nI carved my path through self-learning and constant experimentation, inspired by great directors like Francis Ford Coppola. My films aim to reflect the stories of those who care about what others overlook stories..... of compassion, struggle, and hope.\n\nAs the founder of the independent production company Sam Will Art\nI channel my vision into projects that pulse with authenticity and emotional honesty. I see the camera as an instrument of love, always placing it at eye level with my subjects ... whether human, animal, or plant... to capture the raw truth of life without embellishment, but with deep sincerity.\n\nMy work is a continuous journey in crafting cinema that breathes and bleeds  honest, fragile, defiant, and full of hope .... a mirror to the world's complexities and the quiet acts of sanctity within it.",
